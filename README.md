## About Ticket Hive

Existing ticketing systems suffer from inefficiencies and risks in ticket resale, leading to counterfeit tickets and inflated prices. Implementing blockchain technology and NFTs aims to create a transparent, secure, and decentralized ticketing platform, revolutionizing ticket issuance, transfer, and resale for users and event organizers alike.It is developed using Hive Blockchain Technology.

## Key Features

* Simplified ticket acquisition with a user-friendly website and a **decentralized ticketing mechanism** offering tickets for flights, trains, buses, movies and various events.
* A robust ticket **resale** feature, empowering users to recoup their investment by listing tickets for resale. Using blockchain technology, we enhance security and authenticity NFTs for each ticket, ensuring traceability and eliminating the risk of fraud. 
* Promotes **Sustainability** as booking and cancellation lead to waste of various resources. But with our add on feature of resell it can prevent the waste and increase **flexibility and user access** to these resources.
* Ensure **immutability of ticket data** on the blockchain during resell and authenticate ticket ownership and prevent fraud.
